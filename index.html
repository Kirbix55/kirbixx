  <p id="letter">Hai Dear Sasha, Happy Valentines Day! I hope you have a wonderful day today, and I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you. 

  <p id="letter">You have a great personality; sweet, caring, and very friendly, which makes you really approachable and fun to be around. I love that we can both be ourselves to each other, even if both of us can get really wild. I really appreciate it whenever you update me every once in a while, and also try to continue our talks even though we've run out of things to talk about, it's some of the things I really love about you.</p>

  <p id="letter">You have a very pretty face, a beautiful smile, and I can't help but notice your thick eyebrows, they make your face look bold, and It makes your face a lot more appealing. You also have a pretty voice, I love hearing it everyday, especially those kisses oh my god-
    Along with your wonderful personality, they make you gorgeous in my eyes.</p> 

  <p id="letter">I'm excited for us to meet and hug each other in the future. While we wait for that to happen, know that I love spending time texting you everyday, and I look forward to us being more together and happier in the future.</p>

  <p id="letter">Love,<p/>
